# org-info-js
Sebastian Rose's org-info-js branched from the Worg project with project history.  

The intention is to extend support of org-info-js and Emacs org-mode to support the creation of XHTML/Javascript slide shows.  
The idea is that this'll be S5 for Emacs. Current version just adds an info like view mode and the Org-mode way of folding to the exported XHTML Org-mode files. Searching (with highlighting) and occur is supported too, as well as automatic link creation (Org-mode links and html links, links may point to a certain section or trigger the view mode, occur mode).
